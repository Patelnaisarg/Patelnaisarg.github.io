##**My scratch project is here...**
(https://scratch.mit.edu/projects/719246954/)

when I started python I find it very difficult to complete my assignment but with the help of tht LINKDIN and tutors I get to know where my problems are.

when i searching about my project i found that with python you can develop a game.so I desided to code a simple game with help of the tutors.
while i am working on it I think it will be very difficult task for me.But it isn't difficult as i think.
when I completed my task I find that when I started I don't have enough knowlage of pythonbut afyter compliting this 
I am surprised that I know while loop ,if...else...,as well as some diffren type of coding style,some mathematics solution by python.
I made a simple calculator with it. and more on.
with this tasks which given for activities after python lecture,when i practice this I face many problems becuase it is new for me
